# Precipitation nowcasting for high intensity events

Code related to my MSc Thesis at Radboud University for the programme Computing Science. 

Thesis is building and improving upon previous work in precipitation nowcasting:
- ["Skillful Precipitation Nowcasting using Deep Generative Models of Radar"](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/nowcasting) by DeepMind
- ["Precipitation Nowcasting using Generative Adversarial Networks"](https://github.com/KoertS/precipitation-nowcasting-using-GANs) by K. Schreurs et al.
